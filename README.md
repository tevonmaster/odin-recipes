# odin-recipes
This is my second attempt at creating this odin-recipe HTML page. I am at a beginner level with HTML and CSS. The first attempt was successful but due to issues with my VM I am now completing it again. 

End of Project Reflection: 4/26/23 After a long vacation I've finally completed the project. It was not difficult due to my previous experience with html and css. There was not anything new that was learned; however, it did prove to be a nice reminder on my html and css skills.
